The band has eight members: Bang Chan, Lee Know, Changbin, Hyunjin, Han, Felix, Seungmin, and I.N. Former member Woojin left the band in 2019. Stray Kids primarily self-produces its recordings; the main production team is named 3Racha and consists of Bang Chan, Changbin, and Han, and the other members frequently participate in songwriting.\\nThe leader, Bang Chan, personally selected each member to be a part of the band before filming the eponymous 2017 reality television show, which is unusual in K-pop, where that authority is usually held by the agency\\'s executives and creative directors. The band released their unofficial debut extended play (EP) Mixtape in January 2018 and officially debuted on March 25 with the EP I Am Not, which was followed by the EPs I Am Who and I Am You, completing the I Am EP series. The Clé trilogy, consisting of Clé 1: Miroh, Clé 2: Yellow Wood, and Clé: Levanter, was released in 2019.\\nThe band\\'s first studio album, Go Live (2020), became its first platinum-certified album by the Korea Music Content Association (KMCA). That year, Stray Kids made their Japanese debut with the compilation album SKZ2020, which was released through Epic Records Japan. Their debut Japanese single, \"Top\", debuted atop the Oricon Singles Chart, making them the fourth foreign male artist to do so with their first single.\\nIn 2021, Stray Kids\\' second studio album, Noeasy, became its first million-selling album. After signing with Republic Records for promotions in the United States in 2022, the band released their EPs Oddinary, Maxident (both 2022), Rock-Star (2023), and Ate (2024); their studio albums 5-Star (2023) & Karma (2025); and their mixtapes Hop (2024) & Do It (2025). These eight releases peaked at number one on the US Billboard 200, making them the first act to debut at the top of the Billboard 200 with their first eight charted releases. The KMCA certified 5-Star five million in album sales, making Stray Kids the third group to achieve this in Korea. In 2023, the band appeared on Time\\'s list of Next Generation Leaders. As of December 2024, Stray Kids has sold over 31 million albums, both Korean and Japanese releases.\\n\\n',\n",
